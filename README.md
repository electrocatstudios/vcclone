## Running Code
To run the code you will need to install `trunk` via Cargo. Then
run the following:

```bash
trunk serve
```

And it should serve the page on [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080)

## YouTube
I'm only adding to the code base when live-streaming, I'll post links
to the videos when they are done.

| Episode | Description | Link |
|---|---|---|
| Episode 1 | Introduction Code | [https://youtube.com/live/kgTjhOSb1lA](https://youtube.com/live/kgTjhOSb1lA) |
| Episode 2 | Adding in walls and images | [https://youtube.com/live/xhV10DZar5s](https://youtube.com/live/xhV10DZar5s) |

*The original Episode 2 was a bit of a disaster as I didn't realise you had to push the "Start Stream" button on 
YouTube as well as on OBS. So I have saved the code on this [Branch](https://github.com/electrocatstudios/vcclone/tree/stream-2-no-live-disaster). 
The last 15 mins or so are available: [https://youtube.com/live/AR6o6vyJIuU](https://youtube.com/live/AR6o6vyJIuU)
