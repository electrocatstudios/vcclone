# vcclone
A simple 2d game in the spirit of virtua-cop

## Running Code
To run the code you will need to install `trunk` via Cargo. Then
run the following:

```bash
trunk serve
```

And it should serve the page on [http://127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080)

## YouTube
I'm only adding to the code base when live-streaming, I'll post links
to the videos when they are done.
